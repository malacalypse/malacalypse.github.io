Studio::DC Creative is a creative collaboration specializing in social design and cultural architecture. Our core skills blend performance, visual, and graphic arts with high-tech expertise such as Arduino microchip systems, complex internet application development, and creative data analysis.   

We identify needs and create mindful change by engaging communities at all levels, facilitating constructive communication for all involved. Our outside-the-box methods and attitudes help find novel solutions to difficult situations, build more vibrant and stable communities, and cultivate a pay-it-forward mentality which ultimately ensure an ongoing return for social and cultural investment.

Much of what we do is focused on creative professionals and organizations such as performance artists, agencies, and foundations. We enjoy blending high tech solutions with creative enterprise and grassroots social projects to enable meaningful change and new, innovative, and beautiful interactions.  

Social Creativity:   

We're also passionate about using data and analytic tools to support social change efforts, such as helping to demonstrate the usefulness of bike lanes in your town (and where they are most needed). Our team is multi-cultural and we love to research - if another community has successfully addressed a social issue in a creative way we're stoked to learn as much as we can and bring those lessons forward to your project.

Core Services

We're a small shop with large reach - we have a diverse network of skilled and passionate creatives we can bring in to join us as needed. In-house we provide high quality core services such as videography and photography, graphic and web design, and technical project management. While we're good at these things and enjoy helping creatives with them, where we really love to share our talents is in performance art and social creativity.

Performance Art

From pop-up street events to custom gallery installations, we understand how to share your vision in a dynamic, visual manner. We can help with everything from livestreaming/liveblogging to incorporating reactive art and technology to inform creative efforts and bring fresh levels of interaction, motion, and networking to your performances. Need social integration such as a twitter campaign in realtime for your pop-up performance? Want to use real-time internet data to change your set's lighting or bring a new level of audience interaction to your wardrobe with integrated motion sensors? We can help. Same thing for those of you with complex installations who desire fascinating interactive behavior.     

Interactive and Interface Design

We provide a diverse set of interactive and design services, from advice on how to integrate technology into your creative project all the way to delivering custom equipment, programming, or user interfaces for an installation piece. We blend an awareness of and deep appreciation for the aesthetic and contextual needs of your project with expertise in the technologies that can enhance them. And as much as we enjoy mixing technology and creativity, we're equally comfortable knowing when technology is not the answer for a given project, and we'll help you figure out the best balance based on your philosophy, aesthetic, and specific needs.
